/*The cinema has n rows, each row consists of m seats (n and m do not exceed 20). The two-dimensional matrix stores the information on the sold tickets, number 1 means that the ticket for this place is already sold, the number 0 means that the place is available. You want to buy k tickets to the neighboring seats in the same row. Find whether it can be done.
