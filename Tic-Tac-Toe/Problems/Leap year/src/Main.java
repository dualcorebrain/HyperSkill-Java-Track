/*
Find whether the given year is a leap year.

Just a reminder: leap years are those years in which the year’s number is either divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or divisible by 400 (for example, the year 2000 is a leap year, but the year 2100 will not be a leap year).

The program should work correctly for the years 1900 ≤ n ≤ 3000.

Output "Leap" (case-sensitive) if the given year is a leap year, and "Regular" otherwise.

It is enough to write a simple conditional statement to solve this task.

Sample Input 1:

2100
Sample Output 1:

Regular
Sample Input 2:

2000
Sample Output 2:

Leap
